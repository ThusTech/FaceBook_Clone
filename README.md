## Running the HTML File
Follow these steps to run the HTML file:

* Download the HTML file: If you haven't already, download the HTML file to your computer.
* Locate the HTML file: Navigate to the directory where the HTML file is saved.
* Open the HTML file: Double-click the HTML file to open it in your default web browser.
* View the HTML content: The HTML file should now be displayed in your web browser, allowing you to view and interact with its content.

## Additional Notes
If you encounter any issues or errors while running the HTML file, ensure that  your web browser is up to date and supports HTML5 features.
